# MATH-110A-Project-1
Implementing Steepest Gradient Descent

By Alicia Chuang, Tyler Brown, Vinachau Pham


Project Description

Implemention of the steepest descent algorithm using the secant method for the line search to determine optimal step size at each iteration.

Functions are tested on the Rosenbrock function and the paraboloid function.
